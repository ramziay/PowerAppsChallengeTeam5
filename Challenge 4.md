# Challenge 4: Enhance Canvas App

## Background

You showed the canvas app to the CTO, he was delighted by your work and approved the app for soft launch. However, he started receiving some feedback from the users that they encountered some problem types that were not included in the dropdown list. He asked you to add a feature to the app that would enable users to request new problem types to be added to the dropdown list.

## Challenge

In this challenge, you will enhance your application. First, create a new table Requests for users to fill in a Requested type. On the main screen, put a button that says something like 'Not finding what you need?'. When someone clicks that button, it should take them to a new screen. On the new screen, they are able to submit a new request. Make sure there's a space for them to type it in and a button to submit it. After they submit it, they will be redirected to a new screen that shows them a thank you message and gives them a way to go back to the main screen

#### Hints

- 'Update form and views' after creating the new table
- Make sure the default mode of the form is 'New'
- You can write two functions on the same 'OnSelect' by separating them with ';'

## Success Criteria

- The new column should be of type text
- The table in Dataverse should be populated by the new user request upon submission
- The app should work as described in the challenge.
- Present your enhanced app to your coach
