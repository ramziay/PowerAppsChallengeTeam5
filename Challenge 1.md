# Challenge 1: Collect info

## Background

You are a developer at B-Tech Solutions, a company that provides innovative solutions for various industries. One day, your Chief Tech Officer came to you with a new challenge. The HR department had received many complaints from employees who were facing issues in their buildings and offices, such as broken elevators, faulty air conditioners, or leaking pipes. He asked you to create an app that would help the employees report and resolve these problems quickly and easily. The app would allow the users to select a problem type from a list of options, and then display the contact information of the relevant department who could fix it.

Before you start building the app, you need to sketch the diagram of a data model. You were provided with the following data:
 - Department contains the name, phone number and email 
 - Problem has problem type 

## Challenge

For this challenge, you'll need to create a Data Model Diagram. Think of this as a drawing where you show different tables, and list out what goes inside each table (these are your columns). Also, make sure to show how these tables are connected to each other. When you're done with your drawing, you'll show it to a coach to explain what you've done

#### Hints

- Use whatever tools you have available; you can use a whiteboard, Visio, PowerPoint, OneNote, even a piece of paper and a pen!


## Success Criteria

- Data model diagram should have 2 tables: 'Department' and 'Problem'
- The diagram should have the correct columns for each table
- The diagram should specify a one-to-many relationships between the two tables
- Present your data model diagram to your coach
