# Challenge 3: Build Canvas App

## Background

You presented the data model structure in Microsoft Dataverse to the CTO, showing how it matched the data diagram. He was impressed by your work. He then asked you to move on to the next stage of the project and build a canvas app for mobile phones that would allow users to interact with the data in Dataverse. And use Power Apps Studio to create the app, design the User Interface and connect it to Dataverse.

## Challenge

In this challenge, you will create a canvas app in Power Apps Studio. The app will contain a drop-down filled with the problem types choices. When a user selects a problem type, show text containing information about the department related.

#### Hints

- Make sure your app is for phones
- Use the 'Choices' formula to display the problem type choices in the canvas app dropdown
- Add a label for each department information, Use the 'Lookup' function in PowerFx on each label to display the related info

## Success Criteria

- Your app should be connected to the data model you previously created in Dataverse
- The app should have the functionalities described in the challenge
- Display the correct department information (Name, Phone, Email) based on the user-selected problem
